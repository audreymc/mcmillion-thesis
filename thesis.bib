abstract = {This study proposes a novel approach for modeling financial time series, concentrating on data pre-processing and selecting effective features in conventional and proposed modeling processes. In this context, three selected machine learning methods (including RF, XGBoost, and LSTM) are utilized on the return series of a selected cryptocurrency (bitcoin). The sample data was covered from 16 August 2018 to 22 June 2022. Moreover, three approaches (conventional, intermediate, and proposed) have been considered, each representing a different modeling process. The intermediate approach is a modeling process that only reflects the effect of the specific cross-validation method with purging and embargo operation in the output results (with the same selected features as the conventional process). Comparing the results of proposed and intermediate processes showed the effect of Purging and Embargo operations on decreasing the generalization error, and based on all evaluation metrics, the proposed approach has performed better than other modeling processes. The findings of this study have significant implications for investors, academic researchers, and policymakers.}

@book{brockwell2016introduction,
  abstract = {This book is aimed at the reader who wishes to gain a working knowledge of time series and forecasting methods as applied to economics, engineering and the natural and social sciences. It assumes knowledge only of basic calculus, matrix algebra and elementary statistics.  This third edition contains detailed instructions for the use of the professional version of the Windows-based computer package ITSM2000, now available as a free download from the Springer Extras website. The logic and tools of time series model-building are developed in detail. Numerous exercises are included and the software can be used to analyze and forecast data sets of the user's own choosing. The book can also be used in conjunction with other time series packages such as those included in R. The programs in ITSM2000 however are menu-driven and can be used with minimal investment of time in the computational details.

The core of the book covers stationary processes, ARMA and ARIMA processes, multivariate time series and state-space models, with an optional chapter on spectral analysis. Many additional special topics are also covered.},

ABSTRACT = {Investing in stocks and shares is a common strategy to pursue potential gains while considering future financial needs, such as retirement and children’s education. Effectively managing investment risk requires thoroughly analyzing stock market returns and making informed predictions. Traditional models often utilize normal variance distributions to describe these returns. However, stock market returns often deviate from normality, exhibiting skewness, higher kurtosis, heavier tails, and a more pronounced center. This paper investigates the Laplace distribution and its generalized forms, including asymmetric Laplace, skewed Laplace, and the Kumaraswamy Laplace distribution, for modeling stock market returns. Our analysis involves a comparative study with the widely-used Variance-Gamma distribution, assessing their fit with the weekly returns of the S&P 500 Index and its eleven business sectors, drawing parallel inferences from international stock market indices like IBOVESPA and KOSPI for emerging and developed economies, as well as the 20+ Years Treasury Bond ETFs and individual stocks across varied time horizons. The empirical findings indicate the superior performance of the Kumaraswamy Laplace distribution, which establishes it as a robust alternative for precise return predictions and efficient risk mitigation in investments.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
edition = {2nd},
abstract = {The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with a solid background and understanding of the basic results and methods in probability theory before entering into more advanced courses. The first six chapters focus on some central areas of what might be called pure probability theory: multivariate random variables, conditioning, transforms, order variables, the multivariate normal distribution, convergence. A final chapter is devoted to the Poisson process as a means both to introduce stochastic processes and to apply many of the techniques introduced earlier in the text. Students are assumed to have taken a first course in probability, though no knowledge of measure theory is assumed. Throughout, the presentation is thorough and includes many examples that are discussed in detail. Thus, students considering more advanced research in probability theory will benefit from this wide-ranging survey of the subject that provides them with a foretaste of the subjects many treasures. The present second edition offers updated content, one hundred additional problems for solution, and a new chapter that provides an outlook on further areas and topics, such as stable distributions and domains of attraction, extreme value theory and records, and martingales. The main idea is that this chapter may serve as an appetizer to the more advanced theory.}

@article{Liu_ensemble,
	abstract = {Anomaly detection is a highly important task in the field of data analysis. Traditional anomaly detection approaches often strongly depend on data size, structure and features, while introducing the idea of ensemble into anomaly detection can greatly improve the generalization ability. Ensemble-based anomaly detection methods still face some challenges, however, such as data imbalance, time and space demand and the selection of base detectors. To this end, we propose a selective ensemble method for anomaly detection based on parallel learning (SEAD-PL). First, a differentiated stratified sampling method is designed to alleviate the problem of data imbalance. Then, a distributed parallel training frame is built to address the problem of excessive time and space consumption for base detector training. Finally, a clustering-based ensemble selection strategy is introduced to balance the accuracy and diversity of base detectors. Experiments are performed on six datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed method has obvious advantages over four selected methods.},

The algorithm proposed in this paper is based on the Ridge Regression procedure (which is usually used for outputting bare predictions) and is much faster than the existing transductive techniques.

 theoretical framework for estimating the
 uncertainties of any predictive algorithms as its
 methodology is general and systematic with few
 assumptions. CP methods can be abstracted into
 building blocks that can be deployed on any type of
 data, model, or task. In this work, we contribute to
 the wide diffusion of the CP framework by developing
 the library MAPIE1 that implements such principles
 and can address seamlessly different tasks
 (e.g. classification, regression, time-series) and
 in different settings (split and
 cross-conformal). All these concepts are under a
 common umbrella with an emphasis on readability,
 transparency, and reliability, hence supporting the
 principles of trustworthy AI. An original feature of
 MAPIE is to offer the possibility of designing
 tailored-made non-conformity scores in particular
 p-normalized residual non-conformal scores that can
 be defined to account for asymmetric errors. We show
 theoretically the marginal coverage guarantee in
 several settings. We highlight through applications
 the interest of choosing different non-conformity
 scores for tabular data when considering local
 coverage.}

ABSTRACT = {In the broad scientific field of time series forecasting, the ARIMA models and their variants have been widely applied for half a century now due to their mathematical simplicity and flexibility in application. However, with the recent advances in the development and efficient deployment of artificial intelligence models and techniques, the view is rapidly changing, with a shift towards machine and deep learning approaches becoming apparent, even without a complete evaluation of the superiority of the new approach over the classic statistical algorithms. Our work constitutes an extensive review of the published scientific literature regarding the comparison of ARIMA and machine learning algorithms applied to time series forecasting problems, as well as the combination of these two approaches in hybrid statistical-AI models in a wide variety of data applications (finance, health, weather, utilities, and network traffic prediction). Our review has shown that the AI algorithms display better prediction performance in most applications, with a few notable exceptions analyzed in our Discussion and Conclusions sections, while the hybrid statistical-AI models steadily outperform their individual parts, utilizing the best algorithmic features of both worlds.},
